Description:
It appears that my cat has gotten itself stuck in a tree... It's really tall and I can't seem to reach it. Maybe you can throw a snake at the tree to find it?  Oh, you want to know what my cat looks like? I put a picture in the hints.

Hint : 
Here, my cat looks like this:
#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E 
#FFC90E#000000#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFFFFF 
#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF 
#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF 
#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF 
#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFC90E#FFFFFF#FFFFFF#FFFFFF 

Solution :
We have a huge folder, which contains folder, which contains folder, ...
There are some .jpg sometimes, but most of them are fake (there is "rtcp{....}" but it isn't the flag).

I wrote my own program to find the different .jpg.
All of .jpg have of 1496 or 1718 octets.
EXCEPT ONE : P24AKQCA/I0E91C/6SF60/N02AKM/EAJCOQ6/ENP92.jpg : 2208 octets.
Open this picture and you will find the flag.

Flag : rtcp{meow_sharp_pidgion_rice_tree}
