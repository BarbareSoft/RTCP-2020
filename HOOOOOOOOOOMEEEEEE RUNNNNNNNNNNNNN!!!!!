Hint :
Ecbf1HZ_kd8jR5K?[";(7;aJp?[4>J?Slk3<+n'pF]W^,F>._lB/=r


Solution : 
As said in the description, to have the flag we only need to find the right base.
We already know it's more than 64.
With some research, we find base85decode, some website can decode the string for us.

Flag : 
rtcp{uH_JAk3_w3REn't_y0u_4t_Th3_uWust0r4g3}
