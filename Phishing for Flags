Description:
I got a bunch of emails from people across the galaxy... some are more interesting than others.

Hint :
You only have two tries, so be careful :D

Solution :
In the Email folder, you have 6 files, 6 messages.
By inspecting all of them, you will find in GIVE ME BACK MY EYEHOLES.eml a link to RTCP website.

You will find the flag on this webpage.
