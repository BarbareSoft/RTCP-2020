Description :
Happy MLK day! (January 20th for y'alls non-American folk).



Hints :
- What's does the challenge name have to do with its theme?
- Flag format is rtcp(...) not rtcp{}
- The text you use to solve this challenge may slightly vary by a few characters, spacing etc. If these exists, correct them to make it a valid string of english words separated by -s


Solution :
Thanks to the first hint, i search "FBI MLK" on the web.
I found a letter (from the FBI) send to MLK about suicide.
On MESSAGE.txt, I guessed one line = one letter. So there are 3 information to find a letter :
- First number between 1 and 6          -> which paragraph ?
- Second number between 0 and 15        -> which line ?
- Last number between 0 and 63          -> which character ?

By doing it on my own, i found : rtcp(halpy_fifti tf_mll_day_ameiica_oes_lome_a_iong_way)
(some website may do it for us, but i was inspired....)
The third hint said there are some mistake on a few characters, so let's correct it !

Flag : 
rtcp(happy_fiftieth_mlk_day_america_has_come_a_long_way)
