Hint : 
once you've figured this out, head to discord's #catchat channel.

Solution : 
Honnestly, i didn't find the decryption method for the first time.
So i check de #catchat channel without knowing how to decrypt it.
On it, you will find lots of message with "nya", "meow" and "purr".

After a while (and a hint on a discord channel), i found an idea. What if it was mo cipher ?

Let's copy all of #catchat channel in a text editor.
Replace "meow" by "-", "nya" by "." and "purr" by " / ".

Now, we will use : https://www.dcode.fr/morse-code
Copy your huge string, and click on Translate Morse.

You will have a huge text, search "RTCP" and you will find the flag.
RTCP:TH15_1Z_A_C4T_CH4T_N0T_A_M3M3_CH4T
