Solution :
We already know flag start by "rtcp{". We guess it's a transposition cipher. On the beginning, i was thinking it was a Rail Fence Cipher.
But no website give me the right solution.... so i did it on my own.
In the string, there's only 1 "t", 1 "c", 1 "p", 1 "{" and 1 "}".
Let's try it.


  t                    l                   y
r   c                _   o               _   0
      p            n       v           h       u           }
        {        1           3       7           r       m
          i    _               _   i               _   o
            m                    w                   m
            
            
Flag :
rtcp{im_1n_lov3_wi7h_y0ur_mom}
